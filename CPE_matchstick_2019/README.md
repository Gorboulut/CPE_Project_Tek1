The goal of the project is to create a program that you can play against.

This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
The is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns, each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick

You can generate a game board with n matchstick line (1 < n < 100).

The number of lines is given as parameter to the program.
The second parameter of the program indicates the maximum number of matches that can be taken out each turn (must be > 0)

USAGE
    
     ./matchtick [number of line] [maximal number of matchsticks you can remove each turn]
